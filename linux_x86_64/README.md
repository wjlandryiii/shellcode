[syscall entry](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S)

```
/*
 * Register setup:
 * rax  system call number
 * rdi  arg0
 * rcx  return address for syscall/sysret, C arg3
 * rsi  arg1
 * rdx  arg2
 * r10  arg3 	(--> moved to rcx for C)
 * r8   arg4
 * r9   arg5
 * r11  eflags for syscall/sysret, temporary for C
 * r12-r15,rbp,rbx saved by C code, not touched.
 *
 * Interrupts are off on entry.
 * Only called from user space.
 *
 * XXX	if we had a free scratch register we could save the RSP into the stack frame
 *      and report it properly in ps. Unfortunately we haven't.
 *
 * When user can change the frames always force IRET. That is because
 * it deals with uncanonical addresses better. SYSRET has trouble
 * with them due to bugs in both AMD and Intel CPUs.
